    "text": "Materials and methods\nThis project utilizes the most recent (2019) remote sensing LiDAR point-cloud data to measure vertical forest structure within the Letchworth Learning Forest near the Ellicott Complex. The LiDAR point-cloud data (“las”) was , originally, horizontally projected in NAD83 (2011) and vertically measured in meters. In order to address the project’s questions and goals, Z-values from the point cloud data were filtered and manipulated, using the lidR and dbscan packages, to find individual trees, tree heights, and spatial clustering of the tallest trees within the study area. The new filtered data set was called “filteredOUT_las”.\nfilterOUT_las was later transformed into WSG 84 in order to project the tree locations and spatial clustering onto a leaflet map.

    "text": "Conclusions\nThis study demonstrates the potential of using remote sensing data to assess forest structure with promising results. The analysis indicates a total of approximately 2,447 trees, with individual tree locations identified. Spatial clustering of the tallest trees were observed in six areas. The overall average height across the entire tree population was found to be 20.19 meters. It is important to note that the results derived solely from remote sensing data and computational analysis, offer only a rough estimate of forest structure characteristics. For more precise and reliable conclusions, incorporating field data is essential to provide a reference for validating the remote sensing analysis.\nIn conclusion, while remote sensing provides a faster method for assessing forest characteristics, the inclusion of field data is crucial to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the results. Combining both approaches will offer a more comprehensive understanding of forest dynamics."
